# CMVP_JTA



1. The governing standard: ISO/IEC 17024

ANAB accredits personnel certifications (like CMVP) against ISO/IEC 17024.
Everything flows from that.

Key principle:

The certification must be demonstrably based on current, real-world professional practice.
The JTA is the backbone that proves this.
2. What ANAB requires from a JTA


ANAB does not prescribe content, but it is very strict about process and traceability.

A compliant JTA must:

A. Define the profession, not the training
Focus on what a competent CMVP does, not what AEE teaches
Tasks, knowledge, and skills must reflect actual practice
Judgment and decision-making absolutely belong here if they are core to practice (which, in CMVP’s case, they are)


B. Be practice-based and defensible
Typically includes:
Domains / task areas
Tasks within each domain
Knowledge required
Skills / abilities required
Frequency and criticality ratings

ANAB will ask:

“How do you know this represents real CMVP practice today?”
C. Be developed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)
Critical point for governance:
SMEs must be active practitioners
Must represent multiple sectors and geographies

Cannot be dominated by:
Trainers only
Staff only
A single employer or business model

ANAB looks very closely at who participated and who controlled the process.

D. Use a recognized, documented methodology

ANAB does not mandate one method, but expects something like:

DACUM
Modified DACUM
Practice analysis survey
Role delineation study

What matters:

Clear methodology
Documented steps
Replicable logic


E. Be validated statistically

This is non-negotiable.
Typically:

Broad practitioner survey
Ratings for importance and frequency
Cut scores or weighting derived from data

ANAB will want to see:

Sample size
Response rate
How results informed:

Exam blueprint
Weighting
Pass/fail decisions

3. Linkage: JTA → Exam → Certification decisions

ANAB expects hard traceability:
Element
Must trace back to JTA
Exam domains

✔

Individual questions

✔

Cognitive level (Bloom)

✔

Passing score

✔

Recertification requirements

✔

If something is on the exam and not in the JTA, that’s a finding.



If something is in the JTA and not assessed, also a finding.




4. Update cycle expectations




ANAB typically expects:


Full JTA refresh every 5–7 years

Or sooner if the profession changes materially




Given:


ESG

Carbon

AI

Complex contracting

Risk and uncertainty framing




…you could strongly argue CMVP practice has already crossed that threshold.




5. Board vs Staff — where this really matters

From an ANAB lens:
The Board owns the certification
The JTA is a governance instrument, not a training artifact
Staff may facilitate, but cannot control or bias outcomes

If ANAB sees:
Staff defining scope
Training constraints shaping JTA
Commercial considerations limiting task definition
That raises independence and impartiality concerns.

6. Big picture (and this aligns with what you’ve been saying)

Under ISO 17024 + ANAB:

CMVP is not about IPMVP options
It is about professional judgment applied to counterfactual design
The JTA is where that truth must be explicitly encoded.

If CMVP is really about decisions under uncertainty, the JTA must say so plainly — and the exam must follow.

If you want, next we can:

Sketch what a next-gen CMVP JTA structure would look like

Or map current CMVP content vs a defensible ANAB-ready JTA

Or talk strategy: how boards usually get leverage back from staff on this exact issue
