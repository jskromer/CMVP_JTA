Design principles for a future-proof CMVP JTA

Before the boxes and bullets, a few anchoring principles (these matter for accreditation defensibility):
	1.	AI is an instrument, not the professional
	•	Judgment remains human
	•	Responsibility and accountability cannot be delegated
	2.	The unit of certification is decision quality
	•	Not model accuracy
	•	Not tool proficiency
	•	Not protocol compliance
	3.	Uncertainty is first-class
	•	Aleatory vs epistemic
	•	Observability limits
	•	Model risk
	4.	The CMVP operates inside value networks
	•	Contracts
	•	Markets
	•	Governance
	•	Trust

Those principles should be stated explicitly in the JTA preamble.

Proposed CMVP JTA — high-level domain structure

Think 8 domains. That’s a sweet spot: rich enough, not bloated.

⸻

Domain 1 — Problem Framing & Stakeholder Alignment

This is where most failures actually begin.

Tasks
	•	Define the decision to be supported by M&V
	•	Identify stakeholders, incentives, and asymmetries
	•	Establish the counterfactual purpose (transactional, regulatory, risk-transfer, learning)
	•	Align expectations on uncertainty, tolerance, and use of results

Knowledge
	•	Decision theory
	•	Incentive alignment
	•	Institutional roles (utilities, regulators, owners, financiers)

Skills
	•	Structured elicitation
	•	Communication across technical and non-technical audiences

AI relevance
	•	AI assists in stakeholder mapping and scenario surfacing
	•	Human owns framing and ethical boundary setting

⸻

Domain 2 — Counterfactual Design & Baseline Governance

This is the core of CMVP identity.

Tasks
	•	Define baseline period relevance
	•	Select counterfactual approach (statistical, physical, hybrid)
	•	Specify assumptions explicitly
	•	Design adjustment logic and boundaries

Knowledge
	•	Causal inference concepts
	•	Counterfactual theory
	•	Baseline permanence and non-revision principles

Skills
	•	Translating messy reality into tractable designs
	•	Defending assumptions under scrutiny

AI relevance
	•	AI can propose candidate models
	•	CMVP validates appropriateness and governance

⸻

Domain 3 — Data Strategy, Observability & Integrity

Future-proofing lives here.

Tasks
	•	Define data requirements tied to decisions
	•	Evaluate sensor placement and data gaps
	•	Assess data quality, bias, and drift
	•	Establish data governance and version control

Knowledge
	•	Measurement theory
	•	Observability
	•	Data bias and leakage

Skills
	•	Diagnosing data insufficiency
	•	Designing fallback strategies

AI relevance
	•	AI detects patterns and anomalies
	•	CMVP decides what is knowable vs assumed

⸻

Domain 4 — Modeling, Calibration & Validation

Not “build a model” — choose and govern models.

Tasks
	•	Select modeling approach consistent with counterfactual intent
	•	Calibrate models appropriately
	•	Validate within decision context
	•	Recognize overfitting and spurious precision

Knowledge
	•	Statistical modeling
	•	Physical modeling
	•	Bayesian calibration concepts

Skills
	•	Model comparison
	•	Explaining model limitations clearly

AI relevance
	•	AI accelerates modeling and sensitivity testing
	•	CMVP owns model selection and acceptance criteria

⸻

Domain 5 — Uncertainty, Risk & Confidence Management

This domain is non-negotiable going forward.

Tasks
	•	Characterize uncertainty sources
	•	Distinguish risk from ignorance
	•	Quantify confidence where possible
	•	Communicate uncertainty honestly

Knowledge
	•	Probability
	•	Risk theory
	•	Confidence intervals and distributions

Skills
	•	Explaining uncertainty without undermining trust
	•	Avoiding false certainty

AI relevance
	•	AI can simulate scenarios
	•	CMVP judges adequacy of uncertainty treatment

⸻

Domain 6 — Interpretation, Reporting & Value Translation

Where technical work becomes economic reality.

Tasks
	•	Translate model outputs into decision-relevant metrics
	•	Avoid misleading aggregation
	•	Ensure transparency and reproducibility
	•	Frame results for multiple audiences

Knowledge
	•	Reporting standards
	•	Economic interpretation
	•	Cognitive bias in reporting

Skills
	•	Narrative construction grounded in evidence
	•	Defensive documentation

AI relevance
	•	AI drafts reports and visualizations
	•	CMVP ensures meaning, integrity, and restraint

⸻

Domain 7 — Professional Judgment, Ethics & Accountability

This is where AI cannot be allowed to blur responsibility.

Tasks
	•	Identify ethical risks
	•	Manage conflicts of interest
	•	Accept responsibility for professional opinions
	•	Know when to say “this cannot be known”

Knowledge
	•	Professional ethics
	•	Certification responsibilities
	•	Legal exposure concepts

Skills
	•	Ethical reasoning
	•	Boundary setting

AI relevance
	•	AI has no standing
	•	CMVP is accountable for all outputs

⸻

Domain 8 — Adaptation, Learning & Field Evolution

Future-proofing lives here too.

Tasks
	•	Evaluate new tools critically
	•	Incorporate AI responsibly
	•	Update practices as systems evolve
	•	Contribute to professional learning

Knowledge
	•	Emerging technologies
	•	Limits of automation
	•	Continuous improvement frameworks

Skills
	•	Learning how to learn
	•	Tool skepticism

AI relevance
	•	AI is part of the environment
	•	CMVP remains the adaptive agent

⸻

Cognitive levels (Bloom) — this is important

A future-proof JTA should explicitly encode Bloom levels:
	•	Awareness → for tools and methods
	•	Application → for standard designs
	•	Analysis → for uncertainty and modeling choices
	•	Evaluation → for competing counterfactuals
	•	Creation → for novel M&V designs in new markets

This defends:
	•	Exam difficulty
	•	Certification stature
	•	Scope beyond a 3-day training

⸻

Why ANAB would accept this

Because:
	•	It is practice-based
	•	It is technology-neutral
	•	It clearly preserves human accountability
	•	It aligns exam content with real professional risk

And crucially:

AI enhances the CMVP — it does not redefine the CMVP.

⸻

If you want next, we can:
	•	Map this directly to exam blueprint weights
	•	Contrast this with the current CMVP implicit JTA
	•	Draft the preamble language that frames AI without scaring ANAB
	•	Or sketch how this supports multiple market uses (energy, carbon, ESG)
